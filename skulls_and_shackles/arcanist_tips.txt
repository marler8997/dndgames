Arcanse casters have always been my favourite. Lately I've been playing an Arcanist and honestly, you don't need that high of a charisma. I went with Human because the Extra feat is really hard to pass up. I think my charisma is a 14 and I think I probably could have gone with a 12 to start instead. For me Intelligence is first with Constitution as another important attribute.
For Exploits I find the two most important are Dimensional Slide and Quick Study. Quick Study is really one of the most powerful abilities of the Arcanist because for a full round action you can instantly swap out any spell memorized for any other spell in your spell book. The potential for versatility is limitless.
Don't bother with Arcane Barrier. Keep those points saved up for your Dimensional Slide and Quick Study. Just make sure you have False Life as a spell in your spell book instead if you really want the hp boost.
When it comes to playing a spell caster one of the things you will probably find out is that many of the best spells you can do would really be considered utility spells. Sure you can drop a fireball, or try an insta-death with Phantasmal Killer. But you'd be surprised what a simple grease spell can achieve sometimes.
Read some guides on how to play a wizard (treantmonk is common). It generally applies to an Arcanist as well. You'll see it stressed over and over that a utility wizard with a few combat spells is basically a god.
At level 6 you've already got past those hard levels for the squishy caster types. It's really all good from here. You'll be flying in the air with invisible shields and raining down fire on your enemies then calling forth entities from other dimensions to do your bidding. The fighter will still be hitting things with a sharpened bit of metal.
