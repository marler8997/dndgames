Current Sacred Geometry Feats:
Persistent Spell | 2 | Enemy rolls DC at disadvantage
Reach Spell      | * | Increase range (1 category per spell slot increase)
Quicken Spell    | 3 | Turns 2 Feat Geometry from full-round action to standard
Heigthen Spell   | * | Treat the spell a N levels higher

Feat Ideas:
Intensified Spell| Increase max dammage dice up to 5
Extend Spell     | Extend duration
Quick Draw


I need a way to enter spells into a document, then sort/filter them by spell resistance, dammage, school, etc

Which spells should I get wands for?
--------------------------
Magic Armor (but the duration depends on spell level)

[Create Pit] Great in conjunction with wand of silent image. Effective on all land based creatures, including ones with Spell Resistance. Can be used creatively to hide the party briefly, or potentially to give total cover in trench warfare (if you have something to stand on)
[Web] Effective if a) you have a ranged party b) You're engaging multiple groups of enemies and want to immobilize all but one group to fight at a time c) you'd like to immobilize creatures and circumvent them (*Key point: Don't let your melee fighters go into the web to fight enemies. They'll want to, but its stupid)
[Levitate] Good for ranged fighters/casters. Also good for circumventing terrain-based puzzles, traps, obstacles, etc.
[Scorching Ray] Especially good if paired with sneak attack, flat-footed advantage, and/or spell specialization feat
[Summon Moster II] I love this level of SM in particular, because you can get all the free Continual Flame castings you want from a summoned Lantern Archon [EDIT] J/k, you can't actually do that, but there are other good uses as described in others' comments
[Resist Energy] The ability to choose the type of energy resistance at the time of casting allows you to totally nerf any element-focused enemy.
[Investigative Mind] AND [Tears to Wine] Had this on a high level alchemist who was able to have it in effect all day long. Paired with the Orator feat, your linguistics skill becomes absurdly effective. Unbeatable knowledge, diplomacy, intimidation, spellcraft
[Pilfering Hand] Ignore other defense stats and capitalize against low CMD enemies
[Blindness/Deafness] So good I've never taken it. If your character has high save DCs, it just seems unfair to use it.
[Alter Self] Useful for a) A nearly undetectable disguise b) Exploring the bottom of a lake as a merman c) Temporarily turning your familiar into any humanoid

Stone Call (Combine with Dazing Spell)

Burning Arc
