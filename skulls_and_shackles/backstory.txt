
Trix was born into a hybrid sea/land elf city.  It was a mix of aquatic and non-aquatic elves.  Trix's father is a non-aquatic elf whereas his mother is aquatic.  He took on most of his mother's aquatic traits, however, he mostly appears like a normal elf.  He spends alot of his time underwater but sleeps at home with his mother and father on land.

Trix's family are middle-class tradepeople. His parents make an honest living, but Trix doesn't find it very appealing. Pirates who occasionally steal goods from the city's traderoutes have seen some of their own goods stolen over the years.

Trix's community was once much larger and prospurous, but has been looted and stolen from so many times that the community is struggling to survive and rebuild to its former glory.  Trix fondly remembers the bustling community and feels that they should have done more to fight back against the pirates. 

Trix figures that being a pirate has all the up-sides with immediate gratification, lot's of treasure, and isn't boring like honest trade work.

When trix was older, he met a pirate in a tavern in another land who was boasting of the time he looted and pillaged his home city.  He murdered him in cold blood and was arrested.  The city he was arreseted in was also very averse to pirates so they gave him a light sentence which he served.  To this day he doesn't feel any guilt for murdering the pirate.  He feels his actions were justified.

Trix was always fascinated with magic.  Both with its power and how it could be manipulated.  However, some in his community punished him for thinking this way, saying that magic is to be respected and is not a tool to be manipulated.

Trix has a well-connected friend in the trade business named Traxel. Unlike himself, his friend he grew up with followed in his parents footsteps and took up the family trade.  He grew his parents' trade exponentially and now manages a large trade organization with many ships accross the area.
