They are taken to another plane on a magical boat, to the kingdome of "Masstoria"

The group arrives in a big castle with a handful of other groups.

The organizer of the group named explains that the "competition" was made up, and that everyone has been brought there to defeat an evil that has moved into their kingdome.  People are being killed. People killed by this evil are identified by the color of their skin, turning very white.

> Spoiler, the evil is the little boy that was taken into the kingdom as an orphaned child.  In reality, it is a very power evil creature that disguises themselves as an innocent child and uses their disguise as a cover.  This creature needs to kill people to stay alive and has very power magic to avoid detection.  They are also very arrogant and love to play with risk and danger.

"Timmy" was the one to convince Alfred to put on the fake competitiion to find the best warriors.  He did this because he's getting bored with Masstoria and wants to find a real challenge.

When Mason explains the evil, he says that the people have noticed what looks like dark sinister magic growing in the top of the nearby "Wooly Mountains", but that it's extremely dangerous to travel there.
