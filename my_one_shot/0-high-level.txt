They are taken to another plane on a magical boat, to the kingdome of "Masstoria"

The group arrives in a big castle with a handful of other groups.

The organizer of the group named explains that the "competition" was made up, and that everyone has been brought there to defeat an evil that has moved into their kingdome.  People are being killed. People killed by this evil are identified by the color of their skin, turning very white.


"Timmy" was the one to convince Alfred to put on the fake competitiion to find the best warriors.  He did this because he's getting bored with Masstoria and wants to find a real challenge.
