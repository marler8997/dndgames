
The Test
==============================================================================
At the ship is a large platform with a booth set up with the sign that reads

    "Sign up here for fortune and Glory, only the strong need apply"

Manning the booth is a large man with a "depressed" look on his face and a long line of people behind it. He sits at a table with a pen and paper.  Nothing is currently written on it. There is also a rock, a telescope and what looks like a wand sitting on the table.

Another group of adventurers stand at the front of the line.  The man in the booth says some words to them, picks up the wand, taps the rock and a giant dark bubble about 50 feet wide appears to the side of the booth.  the knight enters.  A few seconds later the bubble disappears with the group all lying on the ground.  They get up and don't appear hurt but look very "shaken".  They are escorted away as Bruce shouts "Next"!

For about 20 minutes the group watches the same pattern as other groups test their luck, but they all end up the same way with everyone lying on the ground and walking away looking very shaken. None of them really take more a few seconds.

The man's name is "bruce", and doesn't seem very excited to be signing people up.
He's tired of all the traveling and bored with all the applicants.
Bruce, not even raising his head to look at the group says.
  "You are about to be tested. When the bubble appears please enter and defeat any creatures you may encounter. We are not responsible for any dammage or harm done to you as a result of this test. Don't hold back any spells or abilities you may have, any materials or scrolls you use will be restored to you once the test concludes. May the power of the Gods be with you."
  
  > This is an "antireality" bubble.  Anything that happens in the bubble is undone once the spell ends.  All spell slots/statuses/deaths etc.  It's like whatever happeened never happened, but everyone still remembers it and time has still passed like normal. You cannot see what happens iniside the bubble unless you possess a telescope fitted with an "antimatter lens".
  > Should the party do well, Bruce will have picked up his telescope and looked through it to see how they are doing. If they don't do well....not sure
  > "Green Man" look pretty hard
  > Once they finish the battle an eccentric looking character in a purple suit and a top hat will emerge from the ship with applause along with a spoiled child next to him.

When the group finishes their epic battle, they see the one at the booth holding the telescope looking at them. The booth man looks up at the boat and the group sees him looking at a man peering down at him.  The group also notices him with a small child and watches him nod his head towards the "booth man" as he turns away back into the cabin of the boat.
