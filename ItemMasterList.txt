Please read the disclaimer before you recommend new items for the list.

Disclaimer: This list is designed to provide items that would otherwise not occur to players when shopping. When your Druid has his Wild armor and his Druid’s Vestment, and you don’t know what else to buy for him, you can look here. This list is NOT meant to be a repository for every useful item in the game, because virtually anything can be made useful under certain circumstances. Please do not bitch and moan about “Why isn’t Headband of Vast Intelligence under Wizard?” because every wizard already has one. For the same reason, you will not find Belts of Physical Stat; basic weapon enhancements like Bane, Flaming, or Keen; basic armor enhancements like Fortification or Ghost Touch; Cloaks of Resistance; and so on.

This list also does not contain: 
Mythic items, unless they are useful to non-Mythic characters.
Cursed Items,
 Artifacts,
wands/potions,
Mundane, non-magical items, including alchemical items,
Technological items,
Anything craftable with Craft Construct or Grow Plant Creature.

Items with a price of "Varies" have multiple types with different costs, or have scaling prices depending on the player's level; see Scaling Magic Items.

Items on this list are useful to the most common build under which they are listed; some items are listed more than once. 
If at any point you ask yourself, "But Patrick; why isn't X item on this list?" The answer is most likely one of the following:
I decided it was too narrow or specific to be useful to an average character for whom it would have been made
It doesn't support the spirit of the game (For example; a Flying Sled is a boat that flies, but can only carry one occupant, in a game where multiple players is the norm)
That item doesn't actually benefit that specific class (For example, the Samisen of Oracular Vision isn't particularly useful for Oracles)
It may be at the bottom under "Cool, Random Shit"
I didn't know it existed
I might have thought it was stupid
I encourage you to send me a message regardless; if I agree with you that whatever item you tell me about is useful enough that it should go on the list, I'll add it. I’m on Reddit at BrotherPatrick.

If your build is less like the traditional class it plays (for example, if you're playing a Ranger who uses Firearms, or a Vivisectionist Alchemist), it is possible that you will find more useful items under the entry for the class you are most approximating. I recommend you check classes and builds that might be closer to what you’re playing.

This list will also be updated as new books come out, and will typically be up-to-date with all Paizo material the week such books are published.
