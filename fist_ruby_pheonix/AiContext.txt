We are a group of 3 Kitsune (half fox humanoids) and 1 Catfolk.

1 male kitsune named "Kei" who is a rogue and regal looking.  Kei has a sassy pet raven named "Abby".

1 female kitsune named "Kyuu" who is a powerful athletic figher with red hear. Looks similar to Natasha Romanoff from the Avengers.

1 male kitsune named Ryu who is a witch with a half-snake and half-fox pet.

1 male catfolk named "Faux" who has colorful armor.

The group is called the "Fangs of the Forest".

Create me a portrait of the team in a cartoon fantasy style.
