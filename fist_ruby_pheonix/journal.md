or organization (i.e. squad of soldiers or members of a local merchant's guild)
- We have joined the tournament to witness firsthand the other contenders' variety of combat styles and techniques.
- Personalities: Generally animated and thrilled to be part of a tournament filled with so many new and exciting people.
- Sponsors: illicitly gained funds, perhaps even stolen money or funds from a criminal element

Acrobatics/Athletics
Feats to help with grappling
For magic, features to cast spells fast and furiously


We're all from the same kitsune community from "Forest of Spirits".
We're all the village protectors.
Our village follows the God Jin Li.
Because of the busy trade routes on the outskirts of the forest we want to level up and learn how to protect the forest (I want to learn how to steal).
Our village leadership want to stick with the old ways of protecting the forest but there's been some incidents and we feel like we need to enter the tournament to learn new things to protect our forest.
We asked our village to sponsor us in the tournament but they didn't agree we should enter.
We probably stole our funds from one fo the trade ships.

  We seem to be going through various seasons of the year
  I start to notice more ghostly images around the monks
  They seem to be doing somewhat similar movements as us

  - I found a "+2 striking, ghost touch, hook sword" embedded in the chair
  - We found a "potion of tonges" along the NE wall (understand all languages "audio" for 4 hours)

### Session: July 7, 2024

- It's around 11"ish" now
- Before entering the room I cast Forbidding Ward on everyone
- When I reach the center of the room I notice a dead body at the base of the tree in the south room.

- Faux tries bringing the puzzle pieces outside the castle
    - We're taking about 5 minutes each time. We took ? minutes?
    - I finished Ruby at 1:20
    - We dont' think they are one time use.
    - each puzzle set has a different set of gemstones
       - sapphire, emerald, opal, ruby, obsidian
    - Kei completes the emerald one, it looks like a snake eating itself.
      and it starts emanating/humming I get a 39 arcana check to
      tell it has an evocation or conjuration and there is some way to activate it,
      I'll probably need to do some research to know how to activate it and it's
      not of this plane, it's also very hefty when it's put together.
      Spell: Elemental Confluence
    - I complete the Obsidian one, it creats a pyramid. It gets heavy and starts
      humming like the emerald one.  Underneath it is a black smog emptying out the
      bottom. When abby says "The only journey is the journey within" and something
      starts happening. If you activate it you create a 20ft emanation darkness spell.
      Spell: Darkness
    - Abby completes the opal one. Perfectly round ball and gives the feeling of
      euphoria.
      Spell: Prismatic Armor
    - I completed Ruby at 1:20.  It's long diagonally shaped pieces of wood and you
      end up with a cluster of spikes. It gets uncomfortably warm.  Some form of dangerous
      magic is emanating from it. 30 arcana check tells me it can bring out a "Flame Vortex"
      spell.
    - Abby completed sapphire at 1:20 as well.  It looks like a rod.
      Spell: Dancing Fountain

The puzzles are just activated, no need to roll !!!

- We go back to the NorthWest room (where Reebus is) Abby says the prayer to calm Reebus and it works.
- In the NorthEast bug room we find 2 elixirs in glass bottles:
    - They are mutagaens, extremely powerful alchemical agents which come with a strong buf and strong drawback
    - Cognitive Mutagen (Greater Cognitive)
    - Serene Mutage (Greater Serene)

### Session: October 10, 2024

- We begin chanting in the east room with the statue and clouds start to form
    - I sense some haunting voices/language based on my 25 occultism check
      I feel they are trying to seek some type of protection to prevent
      something from happening to them.
    - Irori monk enclaves are usually larger than typical and work together with
      an unprecedented level
    - The clouds start popping into figures of people
    - Eventually the form into people we can touch and can't hear us.  We are invisible
      to them though.
    - Abby left the room briefly and noticed she couldn't see us when looking back
      into the room.

### Session: December 1, 2024

- Faux fucked around with the bag and I left and re-entered the room
    - An occultism 31 check revealed this seems to be some sort of event that has been trapped?
    - We entered initiative
    - The monks responded to the statue with "The Trial has Begun"
    - Faux gets fucked up then gives the bag back
- Kei takes 20 minutes to heal Faux (I'll get my focus points back)
- We tell the monks to line up and we make sure we're all wearing symbols of irori then I mage
  hand the bag away and Kyu took the necklace
    - The status didn't come after us, instead it targeted the monks
    - We all left the room except Kei who stuck around to watch the monks fight the statue
    - After the fight is over the statue is gone, there is grafiti on the walls and the room
      is no longer in good condition
    - Kei is still there and now the monks can see him

### Session: December 8, 2024

- More people come into the room that Kei is stuck in
- Amatar sees Kei and says that no one can just appear out of nowhere
    - he recognizes Kei and says "you're not supposed to be here"
- Bag of holding from the statue
    - bag of holding type 3 (hold up to 100 items)
    - 6 garnets and 4 perls
    - a phylactery of faithfullness of irori, tiny box, you tie it around your head, no benefit if you don't worship irori, +2 item bonus to religous checks
    - a ring of swimming (gives swim speed equal to half your land speed)
    - wondrous figurine jade serpent: activate and you summon a giant viper for 10 minutes
   - 47g30s (added to money)

- The necklace has magical slots to clasp onto 10 features, the magic is related
  to summoning the dead based on my 36 arcana check, there was something about the
  necklace I coundn't understand. The power seems very unique/overwhelming, it doesn't
  feel destructive but does feel powerful.

- Amatar gave us a bell to summon him

- Kei carved something into the tree in the past, and when we went back to the future the carving was different.
    - The new carving is a tribal sun where the rays made out of keys, and it looks like it's also probably been aged
    - 36 society check on the symbol
        - there was folklore about groups that had the ability to manipulate events more than what the 8 schools of magic could change, this is my best guess as to what could have caused the symbol to change. An example group is "the dreamweavers". The whispering pines is another group around kitsune folklore. "The Starbound Sojourners" is another one.

- Ingdani tells us the necklace is what keeps us safe. It is "the pheonix necklace".  It let's you battle each other without killing each other.
    - it also has revival magic, you can use a feather to perform a level 7 raise the dead spell

- TimeCheck: it's around 2ish maybe?

- We reach Level 12!!
    - Should I get the "Locate Object" spell to help find magic feathers?
    - ClassFeat: Counterspell?
    - SkillFeat: Aura Sight?

### Session: December 15, 2024

- We decide to go to a tower about a mile north
- We see some people in enforcer's uniforms guarding the tower
- They invite us in, we see 4 archways with some sort of portal-looking substrate
- They tower has portals, the portans transport you between 5 towers on the island
    - "The North Tower"     X: Just east of mid            Y: Top
