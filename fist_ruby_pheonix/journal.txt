Team
------------------------
- Theme: you are your teammates are all originally part of a group
or organization (i.e. squad of soldiers or members of a local merchant's guild)
- We have joined the tournament to witness firsthand the other contenders' variety of combat styles and techniques.
- Personalities: Generally animated and thrilled to be part of a tournament filled with so many new and exciting people.
- Sponsors: illicitly gained funds, perhaps even stolen money or funds from a criminal element
- Origins: we all met in or share some affinity with Tian Xia (i.e. city of Goka or islands of Minata or nation like Minkai or Quan).
- Strengths: we all practice the art of stealth, slipping around opponents to set up ambushes and sneak attacks
- Weakness: your team has impatient tendencies, rushing into a fight with little to no forethought
- Quirk: you narrate your actions and refer to yourselves in the third person, sometimes using titles or names other than your own

We're all from the same kitsune community from "Forest of Spirits".
We're all the village protectors.
Our village follows the God Jin Li.
Because of the busy trade routes on the outskirts of the forest we want to level up and learn how to protect the forest (I want to learn how to steel).
Our village leadership want to stick with the old ways of protecting the forest but there's been some incidents and we feel like we need to enter the tournament to learn new things to protect our forest.
