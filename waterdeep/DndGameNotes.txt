orc attacked by zhentarim

floon blagmar - friend of volo, the writing wizard, celebrity
- floon has more beauty than brains
- 10 dragons a peice now, 100 a piece when he's returned
- went out for drinks at the skewered dragon, volo left before floon, no ones
  seen him since, it's been a few days
- floon left with a rich kid, well kept, clean cut, says he doesn't deal with his dad anymore
  his name is reanar neverember, his dad is the old lord of the town, Dagult neverember
  reanar neverember is in a property near the end of the docks
- the kenku said "xanathar sends his regards", "follow the yellow signs in the sewer", "tie up the boy in the back room"
- 22 bars, 10 pounds each, worth 50 gold each (sold)
- we found reanar neverember he told us, the xanathar were trying to find some hidden gold using the "stone of galore" to track it.
  the "stone of galore" was recently stolen, the suspect it was zentarin
  so they captured lord neverember because they think he's the one who original hid this gold they were looking for, they think it is embezzled gold
- hyustus staget is the city watch who showed up at the warehouse, gave us the rules
- came through the sewers to "the spouting fish" bars
- raenar owes us a favor for saving him, he has connections with the nobles and with the watchman hustus staget

Black Tower Quest
- Seek out Hlam a monk who lives in a Cave on the side of Mt Waterdeep
  Ask him about threats to the city, try not to annoy him or overstay your welcome
- Vajra (the one who we got the quest from) is the leader of the "gray hands" aka "force gray"
- The "Gray Hand" is a secret government entity, nobles know of it but citizens do not
- The monk was probably warning about a specific person in either the xanathar or zentarin organization

Explosion outside tavern
- 2 people have serpent symbol on them
- 4 halflings
- 2 female humans
- half elf
- lucian saw a guy rifle through one of the dead bodies take something and run
  the dead body that was stolen from is a gnome with a dagger clutched and has a burned cloak
  ratigan stole a bag full of 100 dragons worth of gems from him
  Falla Lefaliir from Corellon's crown (shop on our street) said that she saw the guy who stole shit from the gnome,
    she said he had a limp and was heading for the bent nail

The Wizard City Watch Barnebas Blastwind
- told us a guy was trying to get to our tavern, he doesn't think he as trying to harm us,
  but someone stopped him from getting to us
The Seargent "Saeth Cromley"

Afterward Vincent Trench, a private investigator for "Tiger's Eye"
  (down the street from our tavern), approached us
- he's going to investigate what happened

Ratigan met a woman named Jezren at the fireball scene, she saw him take the patch
  of jewels from the dead gnome
- she hires the city guard to protect her home
- she hires Trench to investigate for her
- In regards to explosion, she said that something (probably a construct) threw
  something from the roof that caused the explostion, then ran off toward the bent nail
  our history check said it sounds like "the automatons" that appear in the "day of wonders parade"
  they come from the local temple of Gond known as "The House of Inspired Hands"

Found some kids, "Martem", I'm "Scruffles"
- He had a necklace of fireball, we told the city watch about it

House of inspired hands
- cross between temple and a workshop
- met Valetta a Dragon Born, she is the priestess of the temple of Gond
- the automoton made another one of itself, and it got away
- Nimblewright detector, detects other "nimblewrights" (besides nim)
  spins faster as you get closer to a nimblewright
- Offering 500 dragons to destroy nim's nimblewright creation
- it's been gone for a week

The Bent Nail
- Talli says he didn't see the automoton, we think he's telling the truth

Gralhund Villa (by our Bar)
- The Nimblewright detector brought us here
- invaded by zentarin assasins
- from the tome in their house, the Gralhunds forged pacts with demon's in the past
  some of the Gralhund family have been known to have tails (even though they're human)

Neverember showed up at our Tavern
- Dalakhar was a spy hired by Raynar's dad
- The spy was on a special mission to retrieve the Stone of galore.  Raynar things
  he was coming to bring us the stone to help him get it out of town to get it to
  Raynar's Dad.
- Raynar thins one of the gangs was closing in on him

At the City Watch
- we decided to go back to gralhund's with the city watch

From Mr Gralhund
- The stone of galore is a creature turned into an ancient artifact, it knows the location of the cache
- House Gralhund has been bankrolling xentarin to kidnap raenar and to steal the stone of galore
- Mrs Gralhund was frustrated with the xentarin, she gave her necklace to fireball to HER nimblewright,
  it was careless and hit some xentarin in the blast, that's why the xentarin were attacking the gralhund
- The nimblewright took the stone
- In the chest, symbols from Asmadayus, some evil demon God...God of sin

Got a note from a flying snake to meet the xentarin tomorrow at noon at Garrund's statue (middle of the town)

Mistshore (dockward)

- Killed a dude with a xanathar tatoo
- A lady had the stone of galore, gave it to her rat familiar the night before and sent it to the moselium
- how did the xanathar know where you were?
