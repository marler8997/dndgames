# Murder at the Motel
======================================================================

NOTE: analyze each character for these 3 properties

1. Means
2. Motive
3. Opportunity

### Victim: Julian Foard

- 32yr old male
- contractor from California
- body discovered at "Sunset Motel" in Garfield, Nevada

### Garfield Nevada (town where body was found)

- small/dusty town
- about 1 hour outside Reno

### Veronica Rodriguez

- housekeeper at the Sunset Motel
- neighbor to Eugene Young
- says she is "close" to the victim
   - met when Chad was hired to fix up the motel
   - fond of Chad, said he looked like an average hard-working guy but knew he has the "soul of an artist"
- Ex of Chad Willhelm
   - almost married until he tried to rob a bank
- She thought Chad was in his room the "whole time" but he could have slipped out at some point, but she doesn't know when

### Stuart Dance

- hotel owner
- trying to sell Motel to JRS but JRS says he needs to resolve unpaid improvements with Julian (MOTIVE)
- Motive: Julian is blocking the sale of the property due to unpaid work


### Eugene Young

- neightor to Veronica Rodriguez

### Chad Willhelm (police prime suspect)

- missing, police currently pursuing
- Veronica Rodriguez has insight that causes her to doubt Willhelm is guilty

- Chad's room #102 was only entered twice, once by veronica @12:03PM and by chad @1:16PM, and a movie was purchased @2:22PM, then no one entered room #102 using a keycard until chad was seen escaping out of that room after the cops arrived. So, Chad probably had "NO OPPORTUNITY" (it's possible Chad opened his door to allow Julian to come in and be murdered and someone else carried him out to room #106, but that would mean he'd have to have an accomplice anyway, or, someone to hold his door open while he moved the body and came back).

### Richard Cogswell (rich)

- room #105
- wants to stay in room #106

### Candice White

- employee of JRS looking to by the motel
- 

### Buck Crabtree

- 12:10 PM: room #104 movie (probably buck watching movie)
-  2:15 PM: card 2011 entered room #104 (probably julian entered room to check AC)
-  2:19 PM: card 2011 entered murder room #106 (4 minutes later)
-  2:27 PM: card 2013 entered room #104 (buck?)
-  2:35 PM: card 2013 entered laundry #101 (buck?)
-  2:52 PM: card 2013 entered room #104 (probably buck)



- Told police he left to go back to the casino after that, but we know he stayed
  around until 2:52 PM when he entered his room again
- gave Rich a hard time in the laundry room about having a drink between 2:50 and 2:52 PM sunday
   - did Buck take Rich's keycard?
   - did someone take Buck's keycard
- Julian has a "card key" in his memories tin, maybe he had beat buck in a previous tournament
  in the past? Now buck has won his own tournament saturday.
  Or maybe buck murdered Julian, openened his tin and put his key in there and threw it into
  the river? But why?

### Garfield PD Police Report

### Murder Weapon?



### Police Report

- murder in room #106
- Rich claims the card Chad took off in was used by veronica earlier in the day
- chad ran out of room 102 when the cops arrive to escape (which cards entered room 102 and when?)

Maybe Stuard left his room at #100 at 3:42, 3 minutes later at 3:46 he opens #106 and discovers the body, but why did he go to room #106? And why not any other room?


- Veronica says Chad stole her car and took off


Questions:

- why do we have a photo?
- why do we have a turtle?
- why do we have a tin with a lock?

# Theory

Julian enter's bucks room at 2:15, buck steals his keycard and enters room #106.  After an hour, Julian finishes and goes to room #106 where buck is waiting and murders him.
