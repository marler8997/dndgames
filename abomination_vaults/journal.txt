- we all have a dream with a teefling character that comes to me and tells me
   "Hello, my name is Wrin. The city of Otari is in desperate need for your help."
   "I fear what may be happening nearby."
   "The lighthouse is now lit, and has not been for centuries."
   "Make Haste! Find me. Help me, my city and stop the evil that's coming."
   "I know that you're not near, I will make it easier for you to get here."

  they are wearning a "star pendant" and they have a unique garb (I haven't seen it before)
  she's holding a long draping scroll between 2 hands (not reading from it)
- town of Otari was founded hundreds of years ago
  named after the fallen comrade of a group of adventurers
  recently made a resurgance as a hub for the lumber industry because they created
  a unique system to move lumber from the top of the mountain to the harbor

- Brelda Vankerville is the Dwarf Innkeeper
- I detect some faint lingering of magic in and/or around my room
