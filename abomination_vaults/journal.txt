- we all have a dream with a teefling character that comes to me and tells me
   "Hello, my name is Wrin. The city of Otari is in desperate need for your help."
   "I fear what may be happening nearby."
   "The lighthouse is now lit, and has not been for centuries."
   "Make Haste! Find me. Help me, my city and stop the evil that's coming."
   "I know that you're not near, I will make it easier for you to get here."
