- Bartoz the Cleric
- Venus the Halfling
- Wizenpoof the Wizard
- Achills the Elf (Calb)
- Upchuck the Dwarf (Wesley)

- we start on a quest looking for a magical item
- Achills's patron has called in favors, there is a dangerous magical artifact that has been hidden away. The "rod of the ore gode".  A magical artifact that allows a mortal to command a God to do their bidding.  This is dangerous because God's don't like being dictated to, and will try to find loopholes in the mortal's request to their demise.
    - You can't touch the rod with your bare flesh or the God's will contact you and potentially mess you up.
- We've tracked down the item to a cave
- juncture, ramp to the left (going out)
- right, natural steps go down into the dungeon
- we go down and hear some beast below
- we took down the beast, gained 2XP
- the beast has a patch that is bulging
    - got 24cp 21sp 13gp
- we go through a door with 3 insect men
    - we got them to grovel for 10 rounds
- I grabbed the rod using a sack as a glove
- +3XP and +1 luck
