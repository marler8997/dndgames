* Remember the Card: "The Demon's Lantern"
* Korvosa, ruled by Aodred teh 2nd and his young wife Eliosa
* Gaedren Lamm who wronged me and everyone in the party, he has been a crimelord for like 30 years, guards don't do anything about him
* Steven's character Cadogan:
    - ended up in Korvosa through his travels, looking for a purpose/something to do
    - he became addicted and found a religion that has kept him in korvosa
    - he is a nobody
* Anthony's character LX-14:
    - created some time long ago for a war that has been over for a long time
* Kelly's character Renarra
    - taken in by Gaedren Lamm
* My character Django
    - somewhat poor
    - make money money using psychic abilities
    - my brother was accused of murder but I find out he was blackmailed to give false testimony by Gaedren Lamm by hypnotizing him.  It was one of his henchman who performed the murder and my brother was in the wrong place at the wrong time.


* As I'm walking down the street I pickpocket someone, I found a card and a note:
    "I know what, Gaedren has done to you.  He has wronged me as well.  I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him.  Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there.  Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done."
    - The address is a fortune teller's shop, owner's Zellara, attractive female
    - 2 small alleyways to escape the area
    - the house only has a small window and a front door
    - very small window on the backside of the house
    - Found note on the table:
        "Thank you for coming.  I had to step out for a bit, but shall return shortly.  Please, have a seat while you wait.  The basket uner the table contains break and drink for you."
* failed to use pet rock scam against old lady, natural 1 on Hypnotism
* I know Renarra is neutral good from using Prognostication
* I know LX-14 is a construct (25 knowledge engineering check)
* Zellara, her deck was stolen and it's her only way to support herself.  Her son tracked it down and stole it back, but Gaedren's thugs murdered him.  The guards wouldn't help.  Her harrow deck told her where Gaedren lives.
    PAST: set in stone
    - The Demon Lantern: An impossible situation might arise, especially situations where people who you thought were allies fought against you
    - The Crows: there's a theft of life that seems to be coming but it can be stopped and us 4 can stop it
    - The Juggler: one must often perform multiple roles and juggle many different scenarios, especially when it's not the most important thing you're chasing. Fate is not on our side.
    Present: the events that are about to happen
    - The Cyclone: it's a spectacle of overwhelming power, what might be coming we might not be able to control because of how strong it is, be careful of what's to come
    - The Fiend: tries to find people and bring them to her aid, even the strongest of consciouses aren't safe
    - The Uprising: many diverse people will come together to fight oppresion, they will be willing to help us too.
    Future: things that could or could not exist
    - The Paladin: there will be someone who will stand up to the enemy, they will bring us strength
    - The Cortesan: Those in power have much to hide.  Those in power's rules may not be clearly seen.
    - The Mountain Man: symbolizes the immense amount of death that will be heaped upon the alley's and the world
* Gaedren is off of Pier 17 at a fishery
* We head to the pier that Gaedren is said to be at
* Met Yargin Balko (looks like Licious Malfoy)
   - Seems to be in charge (evil from Cadogan's detect evil)
   - We convinced him that LX-14 is a powerful assasin droid
* Notes of encounter

   - Rennara is holding Hookshanks' Kukri
   - Put Hookshanks to sleep, Renarra tied him hup (16 survival)
   - Yargin is taking us to the children

=============================================================
- we found Zellara's head (she's been dead for multiple weeks, even though we saw hear earlier today)
  King Eodred, he's been in power for a long time, he has no heir, that's why Queen Ileosa came in.  The king has been ill, he is getting on in years.
- We found Queen Ileosa's broche, she comes from a far land, she got married to the king within the last year. Some say she is just marrying the king for his gold and position, hoping to become the next leader of Korvosa.
    - Bejeweled Broche with broken clasp appraise(31, 600g)
   - circular gold, depicts a house drake and an imp in a ying/yang pattern (house drakes are like poor man dragons)
   - The house drake eye is an amythis and imp eye was an emerald
   - house drakes and imps are enemies
- Poverty in Korvosa is pretty rampant and outside the city (in the places they want it to be)
- in the ledger, it mentions a place called "Eel's End" quite a bit
- we should take the ledger to the authorities, we might be able to get some money for it
    - Thourough Ledger with Gaedren Lamm's dealings (seems to be a bit encoded)
        - Written in a language based on Varisian
        - LX-14 Decoded it and wrote the key on the Ledger
- Yargin's desk and cabinet
    - lot's of documents about the fishery business, nothing nefarious
- Gaedren Lamm is a huge name in the underworld and been skirting the authorities for a long time
- LX-14 rescued his companion Fennet
- There's rioting, people are screaming that the King is dead
    - Korvosan guards and units don't seem to be reacting much to the riots
    - We hear people complain that the queen has taken over, that she's just a gold digger
    - NOTE: we don't know whether the king was sick before marrying Ileosa, I suspect she may have had something to do with his death since it happened so suddenly after he married the queen
- Safe places
    - the religious establishments, which God would be able to take kids in (ask Renara)
        - To the Gray, the priests of Pharasma take care of orphans
        - There are orphanages around the city (I don't know which are good and bad), there are 2 or 3 we could take the kids too
        - Or take them to the authorities and let them handle the kids
    - the guards are at Fort Volshyenek
- The guard we talked to about Gaedren Lamm was named Corporol Adanan
- I should have kept the ledger so we could check if people's names are in it for later!!
- The drug that Gaedren was selling is called "Shiver"
- Corporol Adanan brought us 250g for the ledger, and another 250g for decrypting the ledger, also another 250g for bringin in the Shiver drug
- Corporol Adanan says he's known about the sickness for the last 3 to 4 months
    - he wasn't able to be healed by Pharasma, Absalom and Serenerae magic
- Staying at "The Rusted Kettle" in the new part of Korvosa, "The East Short"
--------------------------------------------------
- Nights Rest
--------------------------------------------------
- We hear rioting in the morning, we hear people saying "Death to the new Queen", and "Die Dandy" (I think Dandy is a slur for the queen)
- We run into a man named Amin Jelento
- Got a gold ring from Amin Jelento
    - He has a shop over in the heights, Amin's Goods
- When we see Zellar's home, it looks completely different from when we saw it the day before.  It looks much more run-down
    - Inside it looks like no one has been inside for weeks
    - My wine bottle from the house is still here and looks normal
    - There's a small trail of fog leading out of the building
    - We should question the neighboring shops about when Zellara was last here
    - A fog trail leads back to the ladder in the Fish Hatchery
        - In the hat box we find a deck of Harrow cards!!

=============================================================
August 30, 2020
=============================================================
- Zellara's Harrow deck has magic around it
    - Known to be able to see the past present and future of the person who is being read
    - This deck seems like it might be special
- Couldn't figure out what was special about the harrow deck of cards (low knowledge check)
- I overheard this:
    "Food's growing scarce fast in the city. Hope the queen gets things under control soon. I've heard a butcher in North Point's been handing out free meat, but who knows how long that generosity will last?"
- At Zellara's neighboring book shop, owned by "Smainkart"
    - He said Zellara had disappeared a few weeks ago and was very upset by her son's disapearance
    - I picked up a book, "The gnome's Lost love", over the top older man that has not experienced love in his life
    - I bought The Gnome's lost love and the sequel!
- The man the rules Eel's End is Devargo Barvasi, "The King of Spiders"
- We found an "Otyugh" (a big monster) come out of the sewers into the city
    - Otyugh is an "aberation"
    - Dirty creatures "shit monsters"
    - Can grab you from far away
    - We led him into the sewers using a cow noise with Ghost Sound
- We can go to Volshyenek to claim a reward for dealing with the Otyugh
- Things to do (it's around 2 PM)
    - Eels' end (in Gaedren's ledger)
    - Amin's store
    - Visit guards for our reward
    - Visit Shalim temple for holy symbol
    - Sell stuff
    - Visit the castle

=============================================================
September 6, 2020
=============================================================
- While walking back to the castle, I overhear 2 older men say
    "Most of the visiting ambassadors in Korvosa have fled the city; those few who are staying behind are doing so because of personal issues at home. I've heard that Ambassador Amprei from Cheliax is one of the latter; there's something he's hiding from that's keeping him from returning to Cheliax."
- At Domina square we see a man, who seems like a "Doomsdayer"
    - The eye of grotus has turned from the boneyard to look upon Korvosa.  Do not look away from the danger, it's just there to eat you.
    - grotus is the God of end times, father of the apocolypse, chaotic, lives in "The Boneyard" which is another plane of existence.  Represented by a skull-faced moon.
    - Pharasma also lives in "The Boneyard".  Grotus is a lesser God to Pharasma.
    - Pharasma followers are VERY against undead.  She wants the world to be pure by cleansing it of the undead.  "Lady of Graves" "Mother of Souls".  Very neutral.  She watches over people's passing of death.  She's like "the shepard".  She doesn't want people to go back to where they dont' belong.
- A man grabbed me declaring that Korvosa was doomed, that Grotus is going to destroy it.
- Amin's shop is like antique, houseware, jewlery, prevayer of Goods
    - Ask how he came to become a shop owner, how did he get his start?  I want to know about his past.
    - He got nervous when I asked him about Gaedren Lamm
    - He recognized the "key-shaped Dagger", it belonged to "The Key-Locked Killer" of who there were stories of them being a serial killer. He said he'd get rid of it.  The killings were happening about 5 years ago. The current year is 4695, but the killings happened in 4690.  He killed 3 people, not sure who.
    - His family is somewhat wealthy, he used to be a student for a local swordsman, but didn't work out.
    - The 'Jalento' family owns a shipping company
    - SOLD some things (look at money.txt)
    - I performed "Prognostication on him" to get his alignment and class: Level 3 Aristocrat, Lawful Neutral
- LX-14 sees some shops, magic items, potions, general store, armor/weapons
    - one window is open on the top floor of the weapon-armor store and he hears
        "The Korvosan Guard is stretched thin and is desperate for help; they've taken to hiring common thugs and money-grubbing mercenaries to police us!"
- We got into the weapon/armor shop owned by "Adon"
    - He has an impressive very ornate weapons and armor
    - Alot of the weapons/armor seem ornamental and don't look like they would hold up in battle
    - I find a bin with the "good for fighting but less ornate" weapons
- Ran into some imps and House Drake's fighting
    - They are both intelligent creatures, and are both known to speak common
- The house drakes say they must protect the city
    - they thanked us for help and flew off
- We heard some guards say:
    "No one's seen Blackjack in action for years, and things are as bad now in Korvosa as they ever were. So either he's retired, or someone finally killed him!"
    - Blackjack is a vigilante, like Robin Hood
- Eel's end is a collection of ships that no longer sail on the east end of old Korvosa
- Ran into 12 guards and 50 to 75 laborers dismantling the lighthose at the north end of the heights, the guards were wearing heavy steel breastplates with beautify red ornate carvings
- at the bar we meet Grau Soldado at the Inn on 3rd street in North Point, he's in old stinky unclean Korvosan guard attire
    - He Tells Cad he hasn't seen him since Sandpoint
    - He is a well-known well-liked sergeant in the city
    - He's very sad about the King dying
- I tried to read the aura of one of the guard maiden's but failed my DC check
- We slept at the inn at North Point
--------------------------------------------------
- Nights Rest
--------------------------------------------------

=============================================================
September 20, 2020
=============================================================
- I needed to do a fortitude save before going to sleep but passed, I starting getting a headache and get a stuffy nose and not feeling good but it went away
- Grau Soldado said to stop by the Citadel in Volshyenek

    - The Korvosan guard is helping manage the guard dismantling, no longer the same woman guards dressed in red
    - The guard says it's no longer safe and they are ordered from the Citadel to dismantled
    - We haven't seen any of those guards in red
- We head back to the Citadel/Volshyenek for our reward and to see Grau
    - Grau gives us a chest as a reward
    - I go to the front desk to get our reward for the Otyugh
    - Field Marshall Kroft is the head of the Korvosan guard (came in shortly before the queen), she is well liked
        - She has been at the castle with the queen coordinating
    - I told him to send us any messages to the "Laughing Wave inn" if they have any work or need to contact us
- We saw the a posting for the missing brooche on the Citadel bulliten board
    - Information 600g, return 1200g, return the item to the Castle
- Laborers are not only bringing stones to Jeggare's Circle, but also "Eodred's Walk" near the Citadel
    - We asked the guards whether they are sending the stones to other squares
- Queen
    - The Plan
        - Ask if she knows Gaedren Lamm
        - See how she reacts to where we found the brooche
        - Ask how she lost it?
        - We wanted to bring it in personally so it wouldnt' get stolen again like time
        - How long as it been lost?
        - Ask if she needs help, how she's doing
    - We go to the castle and say we have information about the brooche, and they let us in
    - Knowledge History check - the empty throne
        - As soon as someone attains the throne, they no longer have offspring, there has never been a King that has had offspring for the next King, someone always comes in to kill the King to take over.
    - We met the Queen's handmaiden Sabina Merrin, who is very large for a woman
        - She is smooth and elegant, how would you want
        - We are introduced as the "The Korvosan Quartet"
        - We asked her if she knew Gaedren Lamm and did a sense motive of 17 seemed like I didn't get any reaction
        - She seems sad/drepressed/distressed/speaking the truth
        - Sense motive on her handmaiden to Gaedren Lamm, she reacted to the name
        - We returned the brooche and the queen says the brooche was stolen some time ago, she says the brooche is an inspiration. She seems genuinely concerned about the city.  She asked if we could serve the city more, she said the city could use our aid.
        - She headed back to the back right corner.
        - Sabina gives us a small silver chest
        - Sabina is very suspicious, sense motive says she's hiding something.  She wanted to get us out of the throne quickly.
- We head back to Citadel Volshyenek to talk with Kroft
    - The Citadel courtyard is huge, looks like it can hold a thousand guards
    - We cross the courtyard to meet Kroft
    - We see a priestess casting Lesser Resoration on "Cressida Kroft", shehas not slept for 72 hours
    - She's only been able to go between here and the castle, every little bit of aid, if we are willing she will hire us a agents
    - Many guards have deserted their post
    - Verik Vencaskerkin is a deserter who has convinced a group of guards that the Queen is going to ruin the city
    - A deserter is worse than a lost person, it's an infection
    - They have been hold up in an abandoned shop in North Gate, in a place named "Where all worlds meat", try not to kill deserters if possible, but do what you must.
    - Would be better to get Vancaskerkin alive, but will accept dead as well.
    - See if we can find out why Verick deserted.
    - If there is more to why he deserted she needs to know.

- We found a tavern near "Where the world's meat" called "The Gryphon's Roost"
    - 1 bargirl, 1 cook,  3 groups of patrons of 1, 2 and 3,
    - Cad hears from the group of 3 in the tavern, they're talking about "The Cowhammer boys". They have a gig being hired as mercenaries for "taking care" of people that aren't liked.  They give meat to the poor.  They're no the chaotic side.
    - Mention "The night's special cuts" to "The Cowhammer boys" to ask for a job
    - So...we need to find out what they have against the queen
    - Find out what he has against the queen
- Back to "Where the world's meat"
    "I have an urgent message for Verick"
    "Someone is plotting an attack against the shop"
    "Ask how much they charge to take care of someone"
    "Then ask them to take care of Verick, say someone tried to hire us to"
    "The well being of the Citizens of Korvosa is more important to me than gold"

--------------------------------------------------
- Nights Rest
--------------------------------------------------
- We slept at the citadel in the guards quarters
- We met with Kroft in the morning
    - VenCarlo Orasini, famous fencing teacher was in her office
    - He said Korvosa would be better off if there were more people like us
    - He seems to be genuine, jack of all trades
    - We take the reward
    - Kroft asked us to go back to the butcher shop and search for clues, see if we can find out what's going on
    - Got 2 cophers!! (TODO: enter it into money.txt)

    - VenCarlo's studio is in Old Korvosa

- We left off in the Butcher's shop, we finished the top floor, need to search the bottom (I want to grab the hammer)
    - Kelly found papers with lists of names and check marks
=============================================================
October 11, 2020
=============================================================
    - We killed some "reef claws" from the sewer underneath the butcher shop
- Met back up with VenCarlo to get accross the bridge to "Old Korvosa", where he pointed us towards "Eel's End".  He said his school was on the west end of Old Korvosa.
- Our plan is to tell Barvasi that we're looking to do business with Ambassador Amprei, and looking for leverage/dirt on him
- Gather information around Eel's end about Barvasi
    - Appearance? Barvasi was involved in a "Knivese's" game and ends up winning a big purse.  Barvasi is strong rugged dark man with long black hair and a scowl.
    - Where he frequents? Doesn't usually leave Eel's End. Could be at "The Golden Hawk" (an inn). "The House of Clouds" (the brothel). "The Dragon's Breath Corridor" (smoking room). "The Twin Tigers" the gambling hall.
    - How to get an audience with him? Barvasi wants to know how you can be valuabe to him.  He's hired people to be guards and be apart of his crew.
    - What he's up to lately? Relationship with Amprei? People dont' seem to know about Amprei, the Ambassador. Barvasi is recruiting people to protect what he has.  Barvasi treats people like shit, but people seem to like him and his leadership.
    - Fennet finds the entrance to Eel's End. Guess's Devargo stays in the largest ship.
- We head into The Twin Tigers (gambling hall)
    - Found 2 dark humans wearing red veils, egging on the games and encouraging betting/running the gambling hall
    - There's around 11 people

October 18, 2020
=============================================================
    - He gave us information
        - This evening one of his associates is meeting him tonight at midnight for some type of "drop off", north of the Arcona Mansion in Old Korvosa.  Travel north from the Arcona castle to the beach.
- Gather information outside Eel's End

    - We found "Old City Hall"
    - There is a long outdoor market on Fort Korvosa Boulevard "Reef Claw Run Market"?
    - Ironworks Blacksmith Shop, Central West
- We hear weird moans and noises coming from behind the Exemplary Execrables theatre, people mostly seem to ignore it
    - We notice building connections between the theatre and the old abandoned mansion
    - It looks like people who use the theatre may also be using the palace
    - There's a courtyard between the theatre/palace with a big group of people (over 40).  Looks like people playing a sport with a pig.  There's 2 groups chasing after the pig, and a man sitting on a make-shift throne.  People are covered in tatoos and having public sex and fighting with blades.
    - I also hear hooping and hollering from inside the Mansion.

- NOTE: we can check the shops in the bank for an efficient quiver and probably a bag of holding

- We headed to the bank to check out the shops
    - tried to identify the dagger from Verick's base

=============================================================
- we interrogate the guy that was already mannacled
    - his name is Kaden, he was taken by these men this afternoon
    - It was Devargo Barvasi men, he was paid to pretend to be "Amprei" so we could be ambushed
    - the men have tattoos with a spider web design and different numbers of tally marks
        - probably a ranking
    - Renara took the 17 masterwork arrows
- Our Letter to Devargo Barvasi:
    We applaud your effort to ambush us to avoid your debt.  Your attempt to avoid honoring your word did work out this time.  We hope that you'll take this opportunity to reconsider what your word is worth.  Signed: The Korvosan Quartet
- There was a magical spider web in our room with a message "come see me", I spellcrafted and the spell does not require close proximity
- We received a note from Field Marshall Kroft at the inn that they have more information about the CowHammer boys
- At the inn, there's 2 women sitting at the table gossiping.  They said "they may have identified who killed the king, it's one of the concubines they say".
- Barvassi gave us the key to Amprei's room
    - We found a note in his room
        "Our transaction is complete, I hope I don't see you too soon.  Pleasure doing business with you."
    - We found 3 love letters to the wife of a Cheliax Noble, we can use this as leverage against Amprei
    - This note is clearly meant for us, it's just a dramatic way to give us the love letters
    - I took the silver spider statue
- The information they got from the CowHammer boy's is that it wasn't Verick's idea to start the Butcher Shop, he was approached by a young lady that said it would be a really good idea for him to quit the guard and help the locals with the Butcher shop.  The name of the lady was "Meliya Arkona".  She was the one that suggested the Cannibal Butcher.
- Start the next session walking into Cressida Kroft's office

=============================================================
December 27, 2020
=============================================================
- Reminder: see if we can learn more about Meliya Arkona from Verrick
- The "Arkona Family" has been in the city for a very long time (pay attention to them), they have an estate in Old Korvosa.

- Kroft explains the issue with the concubine Trinia being accused of Murdering the King

    "You've doubtless heard the stories that the king's killer has been named. Yet there's something more going on here, I'm afraid. Queen Ileosa could have quietly had this Trinia Sabor arrested at any time, yet the way in which she revealed the information to the city seems to me like she wants the riots to come back. With the city the way it is, the girl doesn't stand a chance of a fair trial. They'll lynch her the moment they catch her. Even if she did kill the king, mob justice isn't the way. Worse, if she's innocent, the real killer - if indeed the king was murdered at all in the first place - can use this distraction to throw us off the trail forever.
    "Before Trinia is captured and executed, I need to be absolutely sure she's guilty. And that means we need to catch her before someone else does. I've managed to determine her last known address - a flat in Midland at 42 Moon Street - but soon, so will the rest of the Guard, and the mob itself, for that matter. These rumors have riled up the locals something fierce, and there's even bands of Hellknights of the Order of the Nail patrolling the streets looking for her. On top of all this, word is that Queen Ileosa's not satisfied with what the Korvosan Guard's been doing to address the situation, and that she's preparing to disband the Sable Company and reveal a newly founded order of specialized guards to help bring order to the city. For now, I've still got a fair number of Korvosan Guards who are loyal to me, but the problem is that I've got them at work keeping things from getting any worse - and if I were to send them into Midland, they'd trigger a riot.
    "I'm sure you can see where this is going. I need you to get into Midland, find Trinia, and bring her back to me so we can deliver her, safe and sound, to somewhere she can be interrogated - preferably with magic, so we can be absolutely sure about her role in Eodred II's death. Get in there, catch her, and get out without letting the mob or the Hellknights or the queen's guards get their hands on her. I'll have loyal agents and officers nearby to take her into custody. If you can get her to one of them, we'll be in the clear. Any questions?"

    - Bounds of Hellknights are looking for her
        - bands of Hellknights of the Order of the Nail patrolling the streets looking for her.
        - It concerns itself of quelling savage practices.  Vigilantiesm?
        - They have a "Citadel Vraid" outside of Korvosa
    - The "Sable Company" is the group of Korvosan guards that are currently protecting the City
    - A guard revealed he saw the concubine kill the King.
    - Captain Sebina threw the witness off the top of the castle for not providing his testimony sooner!
    - The queen is preparing to disband the guard
    - A fair number of Korvosan guard are loyal to Kroft.

- Kroft gave us each broches "Drake's Mark", they give us a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy when talking with Korvosan Citizens

- Detect Thoughts on the Hellknights
    - guard behind trinia: giddy, money, not very alert because of euphoria
    - guard in front of trinia: anxiety, fidgety, nervous

- Offer reward 1600g (we were sent by the queen)
    - remove drake's mark
    - say that we work with the queen
    - if they don't give her up, they'll be wasting the queens time
    - Gheradesca from Corentyn
- I was close with the King in the last days, commisioned to paint a picture of him
    - who commisioned her? She put her name in a couple of months ago
    - who did she know from the palace?
        - she was brought by guards and then take you home?

        - his grandson Gaekhen is dead beaten to death by cowards in the city streets
        - he can forgive but his son's kin is not so forgiving
        - he needs his son to be burned otherwise war will be waged
        - his body was sold to a Necromancer named "Rolf Lamm"
        - his body taken to a place called "The Dead Warrens" (in the Gray)
        - the man who sold his body is in Custody, his name is Alkaris?? He delivered the body via wheelbarrow.
        - Rolf Lamm was expelled from the Acadamae, Cressida thinks he's responsible for many deaths over the years.
        - Rolf is the only surviving son of Gaedren
        - The "Spirits" told him his son's body is now in the Dead Warrens
- We go to "The Gray"
    - The Gray has the cemetery and "The Temple of Pharasma"
    - Renara takes us to a building, we see Bishop Keppira
        - The Bishop tells Rennara "Welcome back sister" and gives her some sort of blessing
        - They gave us a chest with 6 cure moderate wounds potions inside (I took 2, Rennara took 2 and Cadagan took 2)
