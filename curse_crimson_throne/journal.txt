* Remember the Card: "The Demon's Lantern"
* Korvosa, ruled by Aodred teh 2nd and his young wife Eliosa
* Gaedren Lamm who wronged me and everyone in the party, he has been a crimelord for like 30 years, guards don't do anything about him
* Steven's character Cadogan:
    - ended up in Korvosa through his travels, looking for a purpose/something to do
    - he became addicted and found a religion that has kept him in korvosa
    - he is a nobody
* Anthony's character LX-14:
    - created some time long ago for a war that has been over for a long time
* Kelly's character Renarra
    - taken in by Gaedren Lamm
* My character Django
    - somewhat poor
    - make money money using psychic abilities
    - my brother was accused of murder but I find out he was blackmailed to give false testimony by Gaedren Lamm by hypnotizing him.  It was one of his henchman who performed the murder and my brother was in the wrong place at the wrong time.


* As I'm walking down the street I pickpocket someone, I found a card and a note:
    "I know what, Gaedren has done to you.  He has wronged me as well.  I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him.  Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there.  Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done."
    - The address is a fortune teller's shop, owner's Zellara, attractive female
    - 2 small alleyways to escape the area
    - the house only has a small window and a front door
    - very small window on the backside of the house
    - Found note on the table:
        "Thank you for coming.  I had to step out for a bit, but shall return shortly.  Please, have a seat while you wait.  The basket uner the table contains break and drink for you."
* failed to use pet rock scam against old lady, natural 1 on Hypnotism
* I know Renarra is neutral good from using Prognostication
* I know LX-14 is a construct (25 knowledge engineering check)
* Zellara, her deck was stolen and it's her only way to support herself.  Her son tracked it down and stole it back, but Gaedren's thugs murdered him.  The guards wouldn't help.  Her harrow deck told her where Gaedren lives.
    PAST: set in stone
    - The Demon Lantern: An impossible situation might arise, especially situations where people who you thought were allies fought against you
    - The Crows: there's a theft of life that seems to be coming but it can be stopped and us 4 can stop it
    - The Juggler: one must often perform multiple roles and juggle many different scenarios, especially when it's not the most important thing you're chasing. Fate is not on our side.
    Present: the events that are about to happen
    - The Cyclone: it's a spectacle of overwhelming power, what might be coming we might not be able to control because of how strong it is, be careful of what's to come
    - The Fiend: tries to find people and bring them to her aid, even the strongest of consciouses aren't safe
    - The Uprising: many diverse people will come together to fight oppresion, they will be willing to help us too.
    Future: things that could or could not exist
    - The Paladin: there will be someone who will stand up to the enemy, they will bring us strength
    - The Cortesan: Those in power have much to hide.  Those in power's rules may not be clearly seen.
    - The Mountain Man: symbolizes the immense amount of death that will be heaped upon the alley's and the world
* Gaedren is off of Pier 17 at a fishery
* We head to the pier that Gaedren is said to be at
* Met Yargin Balko (looks like Licious Malfoy)
   - Seems to be in charge (evil from Cadogan's detect evil)
   - We convinced him that LX-14 is a powerful assasin droid
* Notes of encounter
   - I am holding Giggle's Morning Star
   - Rennara is holding Hookshanks' Kukri
   - Put Hookshanks to sleep, Renarra tied him hup (16 survival)
   - Yargin is taking us to the children

=============================================================
- we found Zellara's head (she's been dead for multiple weeks, even though we saw hear earlier today)
  King Eodred, he's been in power for a long time, he has no heir, that's why Queen Ileosa came in.  The king has been ill, he is getting on in years.
- We found Queen Ileosa's broche, she comes from a far land, she got married to the king within the last year. Some say she is just marrying the king for his gold and position, hoping to become the next leader of Korvosa.
- Poverty in Korvosa is pretty rampant and outside the city (in the places they want it to be)
- in the ledger, it mentions a place called "Eel's End" quite a bit
- we should take the ledger to the authorities, we might be able to get some money for it
    - Thourough Ledger with Gaedren Lamm's dealings (seems to be a bit encoded)
        - Written in a language based on Varisian
        - LX-14 Decoded it and wrote the key on the Ledger
- Yargin's desk and cabinet
    - lot's of documents about the fishery business, nothing nefarious
- Gaedren Lamm is a huge name in the underworld and been skirting the authorities for a long time
- LX-14 rescued his companion Fennet
- There's rioting, people are screaming that the King is dead
    - Korvosan guards and units don't seem to be reacting much to the riots
    - We hear people complain that the queen has taken over, that she's just a gold digger
    - NOTE: we don't know whether the king was sick before marrying Ileosa, I suspect she may have had something to do with his death since it happened so suddenly after he married the queen
- Safe places
    - the religious establishments, which God would be able to take kids in (ask Renara)
        - To the Gray, the priests of Pharasma take care of orphans
        - There are orphanages around the city (I don't know which are good and bad), there are 2 or 3 we could take the kids too
        - Or take them to the authorities and let them handle the kids
    - the guards are at Fort Volshyenek
- The guard we talked to about Gaedren Lamm was named Corporol Adanan
- I should have kept the ledger so we could check if people's names are in it for later!!
- The drug that Gaedren was selling is called "Shiver"
- Corporol Adanan brought us 250g for the ledger, and another 250g for decrypting the ledger, also another 250g for bringin in the Shiver drug
- Corporol Adanan says he's known about the sickness for the last 3 to 4 months
    - he wasn't able to be healed by Pharasma, Absalom and Serenerae magic
- Staying at "The Rusted Kettle" in the new part of Korvosa, "The East Short"
--------------------------------------------------
- Nights Rest
--------------------------------------------------
- We hear rioting in the morning, we hear people saying "Death to the new Queen", and "Die Dandy" (I think Dandy is a slur for the queen)
- We run into a man named Amin Jelento
- Got a gold ring from Amin Jelento
    - He has a shop over in the heights, Amin's Good's
- When we see Zellar's home, it looks completely different from when we saw it the day before.  It looks much more run-down
    - Inside it looks like no one has been inside for weeks
    - My wine bottle from the house is still here and looks normal
    - There's a small trail of fog leading out of the building
    - We should question the neighboring shops about when Zellara was last here
    - A fog trail leads back to the ladder in the Fish Hatchery
        - In the hat box we find a deck of Harrow cards!!

=============================================================
August 30, 2020
=============================================================
- Zellara's Harrow deck has magic around it
    - Known to be able to see the past present and future of the person who is being read
    - This deck seems like it might be special
- Couldn't figure out what was special about the harrow deck of cards (low knowledge check)
- I overheard this:
    "Food's growing scarce fast in the city. Hope the queen gets things under control soon. I've heard a butcher in North Point's been handing out free meat, but who knows how long that generosity will last?"
- At Zellara's neighboring book shop, owned by "Smainkart"
    - He said Zellara had disappeared a few weeks ago and was very upset by her son's disapearance
    - I picked up a book, "The gnome's Lost love", over the top older man that has not experienced love in his life
    - I bought The Gnome's lost love and the sequel!
- The man the rules Eel's End is Devargo Barvaso, "The King of Spiders"
- We found an "Otyugh" (a big monster) come out of the sewers into the city
    - Otyugh is an "aberation"
    - Dirty creatures "shit monsters"
    - Can grab you from far away
    - We led him into the sewers using a cow noise with Ghost Sound
- We can go to Volshyenek to claim a reward for dealing with the Otyugh
- Things to do (2 PM)
    - Eels' end (in Gaedren's ledger)
    - Amin's store
    - Visit guards for our reward
    - Visit Shalim temple for holy symbol
    - Sell stuff
    - Visit the castle
