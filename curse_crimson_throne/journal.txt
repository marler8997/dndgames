* Remember the Card: "The Demon's Lantern"
* Korvosa, ruled by Aodred teh 2nd and his young wife Eliosa
* Gaedren Lamm who wronged me and everyone in the party, he has been a crimelord for like 30 years, guards don't do anything about him
* Steven's character Cadogan:
    - ended up in Korvosa through his travels, looking for a purpose/something to do
    - he became addicted and found a religion that has kept him in korvosa
    - he is a nobody
* Anthony's character LX-14:
    - created some time long ago for a war that has been over for a long time
* Kelly's character Renarra
    - taken in by Gaedren Lamm
* My character Django
    - somewhat poor
    - make money money using psychic abilities
    - my brother was accused of murder but I find out he was blackmailed to give false testimony by Gaedren Lamm by hypnotizing him.  It was one of his henchman who performed the murder and my brother was in the wrong place at the wrong time.


* As I'm walking down the street I pickpocket someone, I found a card and a note:
    "I know what, Gaedren has done to you.  He has wronged me as well.  I know where he dwells, yet cannot strike at him.  Come to my home at 3 Lancet Street at sunset. Others like you will be there.  Gaedren must face his fate, and justice must be done."
    - The address is a fortune teller's shop, owner's Zellara, attractive female
    - 2 small alleyways to escape the area
    - the house only has a small window and a front door
    - very small window on the backside of the house
    - Found note on the table:
        "Thank you for coming.  I had to step out for a bit, but shall return shortly.  Please, have a seat while you wait.  The basket uner the table contains break and drink for you."
* failed to use pet rock scam against old lady, natural 1 on Hypnotism
* I know Renarra is neutral good from using Prognostication
* I know LX-14 is a construct (25 knowledge engineering check)
* Zallara, her deck was stolen and it's her only way to support herself.  Her son tracked it down and stole it back, but Gaedren's thugs murdered him.  The guards wouldn't help.  Her harrow deck told her where Gaedren lives.
    PAST: set in stone
    - The Demon Lantern: An impossible situation might arise, especially situations where people who you thought were allies fought against you
    - The Crows: there's a theft of life that seems to be coming but it can be stopped and us 4 can stop it
    - The Juggler: one must often perform multiple roles and juggle many different scenarios, especially when it's not the most important thing you're chasing. Fate is not on our side.
    Present: the events that are about to happen
    - The Cyclone: it's a spectacle of overwhelming power, what might be coming we might not be able to control because of how strong it is, be careful of what's to come
    - The Fiend: tries to find people and bring them to her aid, even the strongest of consciouses aren't safe
    - The Uprising: many diverse people will come together to fight oppresion, they will be willing to help us too.
    Future: things that could or could not exist
    - The Paladin: there will be someone who will stand up to the enemy, they will bring us strength
    - The Cortesan: Those in power have much to hide.  Those in power's rules may not be clearly seen.
    - The Mountain Man: symbolizes the immense amount of death that will be heaped upon the alley's and the world
* Gaedren is off of Pier 17 at a fishery
* We head to the pier that Gaedren is said to be at
* Met Yargin Balko (looks like Licious Malfoy)
   - Seems to be in charge (evil from Cadogan's detect evil)
   - We convinced him that LX-14 is a powerful assasin droid
* Notes of encounter
   - I am holding Giggle's Morning Star
   - Rennara is holding Hookshanks' Kukri
   - Put Hookshanks to sleep, Renarra tied him hup (16 survival)
   - Yargin is taking us to the children
