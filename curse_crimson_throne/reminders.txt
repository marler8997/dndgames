* Ways to accomodate my low AC
    - alter self -- Very flexible. Troglodyte and Lizardfolk are your best two forms; roughly comparable, since Trog gives +6 NA but -2 Dex, and LF gives +5 NA with no Dex adjustment. Trog gives Multiattack, so if you plan on doing that, your decision is done. LF gives +2 Str, which is nice if you want to escape a grapple... anyway. Roughly comparable.
    - shield -- Too bad about that duration. Rod of Lesser Quicken, I choose you!
    - Mithral Buckler -- Hey look, it's 0% ASF and -0 ACP. Get the cleric to cast magic vestment on it every day.
    - Dex boosters (including cat's grace if you're poor). Duh!
    - haste -- (but pretend it's a buff for the rest of the party, and ask for gold.)
    - mirror image -- I can't stress enough how nice it is to not get hit.
