xanderghul, runelord of pride (illusion magic, peacock spirit)
krune master of conjuration

alasnast master of evocation
zutha master of necromancy
karzug master of transmutation (greed)

- The "master circle" in the halls of wrath is the way to escape runeforge
The runeforge well only has enough to infuse about half a dozen or so weapons

Items:

alasnast (evocation) ash
xanderghul (illusion) shards of the mirror
sorshen (enchantment) equipment of delvahine (should be cleansed)


Runeforge Riddle
'''
If magic bright is your desire, to old rune forge you must retire
For only there does wizard's art, receive it's due and proper start

On eastern shores of steaming mirror, at end of day when dusk is near
Where seven faces silent wait, encircled guards at runeforge gate

Each stone the grace of seven lords, one part of key each ruler hordes
If offered spells and proper prayer, take seven keys and climb the stairs

On frozen mountain xin awaits, His regal voice the yawning gates
Eyes turn twice in, psyhedron occulted runeforge waits within

And now you've come and joined the forge, upon rare lore your mind can gorge
And when you slough the mortal way, in runeforge long your work shall stay
