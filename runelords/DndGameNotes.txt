Story
======================================================
Alchemist fire: 2 to the town (4 for me)
Grease/Oil on the north wall:
Booby trap the bridges:
Signaling: horns(1 toot, top, 2 toots middle, 3 toots bottom), Flags

Need to coordinate how to defend Sandpoint
About 750 out of 1200 can fight
Pits behind the wall (traps)
   - alchamist fire for wall
Explosives
Burning bridges
    -
Have citizens line the northeast wall and eastern cliff face

From Teratiknus:
Yorgenfist: valley of black tower and iron peaks, overlooks waters of mooshgoul river
             week away from sandpoint (by giants)
He wanted a piece of the lighthouse form Sandpoint
One way to get to Yorgenfist is through "Kaer Maga" (but they don't like outsiders, they need to lower down an elevator to let people pass)
    This is a rich city, central hub of Varisia
Other way is through Iron Peaks

Thasilon ancient civilization, very magical
There was 7 runelords of thassilon that ruled varasian: but an uprising dethroned them
Karzoug is runelord of greed

ALIVE A2C: All female giants (about 11)
  - Talk about Giant men trying to woe them
  - Halvara is the leader (she has the magic from a good)
  - Fandara, Giant godess of birth death earth and knowledge
ALIVE A2D: Majority Men (some women) about 20
  - The horde of money their going to be getting from this adventure
  - Vlorean, probably the leader of this One
DEAD A2E: Majority Men (some women) about 18, much larger
  - Zinderwall is the leader
  - They're talking about killing their leader, feeding him to the giants
  - Seems like their here to join the army/cause
DEAD A2F: only 4 giants, but camps should hold about 20
  - very slender and lean giants
  - have about 4 or 5 dire bears
ALIVE A2G: about 8 giants but holds about 15, normal giants
  - look like barl breakbones (the magical giant)
  - talking about Barl
ALIVE A2A: about 30, hill giants
  - Talked about lake "Scotha"
  - Talk about loyalty to Mocmorian, will return to ancestral lands along lake Scotha (in the cinderlands somewhere)
  - A bunch scattered and killed each other
DEAD A2B: largest, about 50 Orgres (not giants), 2 types of ogreds (2 clans)
  - alot are bickering or fighting

Killing the giants is hastening the return Karzug!  He is awakening the armies of xinshalast
Got a book Reasearching the Ancient Past
Karzug was the runelord of greed
Ruler of Shalast
Karzug's armies were composed of giants, ruled by Rune Giants
Karzug uses transmutation, focusing on wealth, very greedy
"Dominant Weapons" would be good against Karzug
Karzug warred against Alaznast, the Runulord of Wrath,
Between their nations long the ridge of Rast, they built statues
As their war intensified, the runelords divised methods that they could escape the world in suspended animation
and their surviving minions would awaken them later on

Xinshalast hidden somewhere in the Kodar mountains
Xinshalast was the capital city of Shalast
Spires in Xinshalast stand upon the mythical mountain of Mahar Massif
Mahar Massif is a gateway to strange realms

Near the lake StormUnder
Southwest of Rimeskull I think

Neleveto Voan: from Xinshalast
- How did you end up here?  Lord Karzug sent him to the Runeforge, he was meant to serve
- RuneLords went into a deep sleep to return someday
- It's been 10,000 years

From Quink in Sandpoint:
- karzug will need his followers to bring hiim back
- xinshalast is in the highest peak in the kodor mountains (mahar masif, north east part of verisia)
- redwing has found the way to xinshalast, there were 2 dwarven brothers (the vekker brothers) who found the way
  they bankrupted investors establishing a base in the lower kodor mountains to find xinshalast and scavenge
  janderhoff is located on the south eastern paprt of verisia

The largest investor of the vekker brothers was part of the "StoneHaven group"

There's a "planar mine" just off the "kazeron river"
There's something called "the world's roof", it's inhabited by the foulest of beasts
They have a cabin that sits along a 50foot cliff

We found the path to xinshalast from one of the old dwarve's journal

We spend like 3 days hiking up the mountains, on about day 110

There are 2 groups in Xinshalast, 'The Spared' trades info and 'The minions of the hidden beast', a creature below the
   city tells them what to do, they are very aggressive

- Need to kill the one at the colloseum (gammogen)
