Story
======================================================
Alchemist fire: 2 to the town (4 for me)
Grease/Oil on the north wall: 
Booby trap the bridges: 
Signaling: horns(1 toot, top, 2 toots middle, 3 toots bottom), Flags

Need to coordinate how to defend Sandpoint
About 750 out of 1200 can fight
Pits behind the wall (traps)
   - alchamist fire for wall
Explosives
Burning bridges
    - 
Have citizens line the northeast wall and eastern cliff face

From Teratiknus:
Yorgenfist: valley of black tower and iron peaks, overlooks waters of mooshgoul river
             week away from sandpoint (by giants)
He wanted a piece of the lighthouse form Sandpoint
One way to get to Yorgenfist is through "Kaer Maga" (but they don't like outsiders, they need to lower down an elevator to let people pass)
    This is a rich city, central hub of Varisia
Other way is through Iron Peaks

Thasilon ancient civilization, very magical
There was 7 runelords of thassilon that ruled varasian: but an uprising dethroned them
Karzoug is runelord of greed

ALIVE A2C: All female giants (about 11)
  - Talk about Giant men trying to woe them
  - Halvara is the leader (she has the magic from a good)
  - Fandara, Giant godess of birth death earth and knowledge
ALIVE A2D: Majority Men (some women) about 20
  - The horde of money their going to be getting from this adventure
  - Vlorean, probably the leader of this One
DEAD A2E: Majority Men (some women) about 18, much larger
  - Zinderwall is the leader
  - They're talking about killing their leader, feeding him to the giants
  - Seems like their here to join the army/cause
DEAD A2F: only 4 giants, but camps should hold about 20
  - very slender and lean giants
  - have about 4 or 5 dire bears
ALIVE A2G: about 8 giants but holds about 15, normal giants
  - look like barl breakbones (the magical giant)
  - talking about Barl

  - Talk about loyalty to Mocmorian, will return to ancestral lands along lake Scotha (in the cinderlands somewhere)
  - A bunch scattered and killed each other

  - alot are bickering or fighting

Killing the giants is hastening the return Karzug!  He is awakening the armies of xinshalast
Got a book Reasearching the Ancient Past
Karzug was the runelord of greed
Ruler of Shalast
Karzug's armies were composed of giants, ruled by Rune Giants
Karzug uses transmutation, focusing on wealth, very greedy
"Dominant Weapons" would be good against Karzug
Karzug warred against Alaznast, the Runulord of Wrath,
Between their nations long the ridge of Rast, they built statues
As their war intensified, the runelords divised methods that they could escape the world in suspended animation
and their surviving minions would awaken them later on

Xinshalast hidden somewhere in the Kodar mountains
Xinshalast was the capital city of Shalast
Spires in Xinshalast stand upon the mythical mountain of Mahar Massif
Mahar Massif is a gateway to strange realms

Lord of Wealth, Karzug's trading conquest (how he took over Xinshalast)
Tributes of Adan (talks about all the runelords)
Whispers from Lange (a guide to the Beyond, talks about creatures from other plances)
Spirs of Gold, The Rise of Xinshalast (streets made of gold/platinum, Karzug bio about how powerful he is, Karzug hates enchantment and disillusion magic)
The face above Xinshalast
A traveler in the Golden world

Runeforge in Kodar Mountains!
Near the lake StormUnder
Southwest of Rimeskull I think

Neleveto Voan: from Xinshalast

- It's been 10,000 years
